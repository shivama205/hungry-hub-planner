      "Understanding your daily macro needs is crucial for achieving your health and fitness goals. Macronutrients - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats - are the building blocks of a healthy diet.",
      "Proteins are essential for muscle repair and growth. They help maintain lean body mass and support immune function. The recommended daily intake varies based on your activity level and goals, but generally ranges from 0.8g to 2.2g per kilogram of body weight.",
      "Carbohydrates are your body's primary energy source. They fuel your brain, muscles, and daily activities. Complex carbs provide sustained energy and should make up 45-65% of your daily calories.",
      "Fats are vital for hormone production and nutrient absorption. Healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil should comprise 20-35% of your daily calories.",
      "Our macro calculator helps you determine your ideal ratios based on your goals, whether it's weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance. Remember, these are guidelines - listen to your body and adjust as needed."
