# Transform Your Kitchen with Recipe Finder

We're excited to announce the launch of Recipe Finder, a powerful new feature that helps you discover delicious recipes using ingredients you already have in your kitchen. No more wasted food or last-minute grocery runs â€“ Recipe Finder turns your available ingredients into mouth-watering meals that match your nutritional goals.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Recipe Suggestions
Simply list the ingredients you have, and our AI will suggest three personalized recipes that make the best use of your available ingredients. Each suggestion includes:
- Detailed instructions
- Cooking time
- Complete nutritional information
- Additional ingredients you might need

### 2. Macro-Aware Recommendations
If you've set up your macro goals in SousChef, Recipe Finder automatically considers them when suggesting recipes. This ensures that your meals not only taste great but also align with your nutritional targets.

### 3. Image Recognition (Coming Soon)
Soon, you'll be able to simply take a photo of your ingredients, and our AI will identify them automatically. This makes the process even more seamless and user-friendly.

## How It Works

1. **List Your Ingredients**
   Enter the ingredients you have available. Don't forget to include basics like oil, salt, and spices.

2. **Get Personalized Suggestions**
   Our AI analyzes your ingredients and nutritional preferences to suggest three recipes that:
   - Make optimal use of your available ingredients
   - Match your macro goals
   - Consider your dietary restrictions
   - Provide complete nutritional information

3. **Start Cooking**
   Each recipe comes with clear, step-by-step instructions and cooking times, making it easy to prepare your meal.
